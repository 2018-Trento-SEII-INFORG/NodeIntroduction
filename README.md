# Node.js Tutorial

Node.js is a server-side platform built on Google Chrome's JavaScript Engine (V8 Engine). Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.

We are not going to cover the all the features, only the basics. If you want to know more about how Node.js works, checkout some videos on youtube:

In this hands-on tutorial, the goal is to give you some pointers and tools so you can start building your own node.js applications.


## Installation
You can install Node.js by following the instructions from the Node.js project webpage ([https://nodejs.org/en/](https://nodejs.org/en/)).

If you're using a package manager in your OS, you might find ports already available. For example:
- [Installing nodejs using MacPorts](https://jonlabelle.com/snippets/view/shell/install-nodejs-macport). 
- [Installing nodejs in Ubuntu](https://websiteforstudents.com/install-the-latest-node-js-and-nmp-packages-on-ubuntu-16-04-18-04-lts/)
- If you're using anything else, you probably know what you're doing :)

## Materials
You'll find the materials for the lectures in the day* folders.
